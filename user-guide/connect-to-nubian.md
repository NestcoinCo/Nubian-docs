# üîó Connect to Nubian

Remember when you are always required to sign in to an application to access your profile? It's synonymous with connecting your wallet. When you connect your wallet you are signing in, we can show you your available assets, past activities and you can start earning or swapping your tokens. You need a desktop browser with a DeFi wallet extension or a mobile wallet with a dapp browser, check the [wallets](wallets.md) part of this guide to learn about them and get one if you haven't. Here's how to connect your wallet.

First, you have to click on any of the connect wallet buttons.\

You are shown wallet options you can use for connection based on the ones you have available on your mobile device or browser.

&#x20;                                           ![](<../.gitbook/assets/wallet options.jpg>)

&#x20;                                                                           _****_                                                                            Wallet Options

To move forward you have to select a wallet and connect it to the Nubian app.



If it is your first time on the Nubian app, after selecting a wallet and connecting, you will be shown experience levels you can select to begin using the app.

&#x20;                                             __                                              ![](<../.gitbook/assets/experience levels.jpg>)__

&#x20;                                                                               _****_                                                                                Experience Levels

Select an option depending on how accustomed you are to Decentralized Finance (DeFi). We'll show you a slideshow that explains DeFi and the functions of the Nubian app if you select, "I'm new to DeFi" and "I have some knowledge" options.



Upon completing the connection and/or experience level you are taken to the dashboard which shows you your total balance and options to either fund your wallet or start saving.

If you just created your wallet and connected it to Nubian it will be empty. It has to first be funded. Let's get to funding your wallet.
