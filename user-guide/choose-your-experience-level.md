# Choose your Experience Level

Nubian caters for crypto newbies and experts alike. We have interfaces tailored towards whatever level of experience you have. After connecting your wallet to the Nubian decentralized application (Dapp), you have to choose your experience level. There are two options:

![Experience Level Options.](<../.gitbook/assets/iPhone 13 mini - 28.svg>)

*   **You are new to DeFi**

    This is the first option, you can choose this level if you are fairly new or completely new to Decentralized Finance (DeFi), we'll teach you how to crawl and then run around in the DeFi ecosystem as you use the Nubian dapp. When you pick this option you are greeted with a series of informational pages that explain each part of the Nubian dapp using very simple language.
*   **You already have some knowledge**

    If you already have some knowledge about DeFi, we skip explaining each Nubian feature to you and just let you start earning or swapping immediately. Only choose this level if you are sure you fully understand all the Nubian Features.
