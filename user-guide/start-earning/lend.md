# Lend

Lending on Nubian is very simple and easy. It is exactly the same as lending your money out to a friend, except, in this case, you always have access to your funds and there is a high interest rate. No need to sign an agreement or something, just lend and flex.

Here's a short guide on how to get started lending:

1.  **Navigate to the lending product**

    [Connect your wallet](../connect-to-nubian.md) and select the earn button at the bottom of your dashboard. You are immediately navigated to the different earn products provided by Nubian.

Select the lending product to get started lending. You are prompted with a short explainer on lending.

**2. Select a token to lend**

Select a token to lend from the supply markets, they are arranged in descending order of their APY. You can search for a token using the search box at the top.

**3. Enter the amount you want to lend**

When you select a token to lend, you are required to enter the amount of that token you want to lend. The lend screen above shows you two different APYs:

* Lending APY: This is the additional amount of the tokens you will earn when you lend for a year.
* Distribution APY: Nubian uses the Venus protocol to allow its users to lend. The Venus protocol distributes its native token, XVS to all lenders on the platform. This is the interest you will earn in XVS tokens when you lend.

The interest rate for each earn product is not fixed. The interest rates are dependent on the state of the platform Nubian employs to offer you that product. These interest rates can go higher or even lower within a short period.
{% endhint %}

When you are done entering the amount you want to lend, confirm the transaction by selecting the confirm button. You will be redirected to confirm the transaction in your wallet.

After lending, your funds are put on the supply market and can be borrowed. This does not mean you cannot access your funds anytime you want. You can withdraw them at any time.
