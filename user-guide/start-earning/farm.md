# Farm

Farming is a unique product introduced into Decentralized Finance (DeFi) to incentivize users to participate in DeFi. It is more complex and riskier than the other earn products but yields a higher APY. It involves 2 processes, pooling and staking. Each of these processes has its own reward which sort of compounds your reward.
