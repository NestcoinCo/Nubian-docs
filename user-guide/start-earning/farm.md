# Farm

Farming is one of Nubian's earn products that usually gives the highest return and has the highest risk. Farming involves a lot of hoops but Nubian has simplified this process. In a non-Nubian world, to farm, you would first have to provide liquidity to a pool on a decentralised exchange and then stake the pool tokens you get from providing liquidity on a farming platform to earn rewards on that. This allows you to earn different rewards from staking and pooling your funds at the same time. This would involve a lot of hoops, but we live in a world with Nubian so farming is easy thanks to Nubian.

Follow the following steps to get started farming on Nubian:

1. **Navigate to the farming page:**
