# Pooling

A liquidity pool is a crowdsourced pool of cryptocurrencies or tokens locked in a smart contract that is used to facilitate trades between the assets on a decentralized exchange. To add to a liquidity pool, you need to contribute 50% 50% dollar value of 2 tokens.

Eg. To add $50 BTC [liquidity](../../faqs/earn/liquidity-provision.md#what-is-liquidity) to the BTC/BNB pool on a decentralized exchange, you have to also add $50 in BNB to the pool.

After selecting the pool, you are required to enter the dollar value of tokens you want to stake. You must have the equal value you want to stake for both tokens in your wallet. 

After entering the tokens you want to stake you have to approve them if you haven't added assets to this pool before. The approval allows Nubian to spend your tokens and help you send them to the pool. After approval, select the Add assets to pool button to confirm your inputs.

**4. Confirm Summary**

Nubian shows you a summary of your inputs and the interest rate you stand to earn while in this pool. The summary tells you the number of pool tokens you will get. Pool tokens are tokens that are used to track your token contribution to the pool. They are also called Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens. Confirm this summary to complete the pooling transaction and put your assets to work in the pool.
