# Start Earning

You can put your idle crypto tokens to work and earn interest. Nubian Finance gives you easy access to various ways you can earn interest on your tokens. These tokens are put to work on different platforms by Nubian and can be withdrawn at any time with the yield earned.

Interest rates on Nubian are far higher than the traditional interest rates that banks offer to savings and fixed account deposits. Although the interest rates are high they do come with their own risks, which include platform risks, which occur when a platform holding user funds is hacked. The different earn products are divided based on how risky they are, although the riskier it is, the higher the interest rate.

{% hint style="info" %}
The interest rate for each earn product is not fixed. The interest rates are dependent on the state of the platform Nubian employs to offer you that product. These interest rates can go higher or even lower within a short period.
