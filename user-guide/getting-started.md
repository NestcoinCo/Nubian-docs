# Getting Started

To start using Nubian right away you need a cryptocurrency with funds in it to earn more, save or simply pay transaction fees. This guide is written for individuals with little cryptocurrency knowledge. It'll take you from converting your cash to crypto and engaging in financial activities on the blockchain. You must have heard about these activities before as Decentralized Finance (DeFi).

DeFi allows you to do all the activities you would normally do at the bank such as saving, investing to earn yield, taking loans and so much more on the blockchain. Say bye :wave: to ridiculous paperwork, stress, long bank queues, tiny :pinched_fingers: interest rates and welcome :handshake: high-interest rates, freedom, complete control over your funds and an overall better experience especially with the Nubian web application.

Let's begin our short journey to financial freedom.

1.  **Choose a Wallet**

    The first thing you'd need is a wallet. In the same way, you'd pick a bank to patronise, you have to pick a wallet to use in holding your cryptocurrency and interacting with Nubian. Check our [wallets](get-a-wallet.md) guide to know the right wallet you need to get started. 
2.  **Fund your wallet**

    You need to have BNB in your wallet to start interacting with the Nubian dapp. Let's have a look at the different options you can use to [fund your wallet](fund-your-wallet..md).
3.  **Start using Nubian**
