# Getting Started

To start using Nubian right away you need a cryptocurrency wallet with funds in it. You can use these funds to earn more, save or simply pay transaction fees. This guide is written for individuals with little cryptocurrency knowledge. It'll take you from converting your cash to crypto and engaging in financial activities on the blockchain. You must have heard about these activities before as Decentralized Finance (DeFi).

DeFi allows you to do all the activities you would normally do at the bank such as saving, investing to earn yield, taking loans and so much more on the blockchain. Say bye :wave: to ridiculous paperwork, stress, long bank queues, tiny :pinched\_fingers: interest rates and welcome :handshake: high-interest rates, freedom, complete control over your funds and an overall better experience especially with the Nubian web application.

Let's begin our short journey to financial freedom. Each stage has a link to a page explaining it in further details.

1.  **Choose a Wallet**

    The first thing you'd need is a wallet. In the same way, you'd pick a bank to patronise, you have to pick a wallet to use in holding your cryptocurrency and interacting with Nubian. Check our [wallets](wallets.md) guide to know the right wallet you need to get started.&#x20;
2.  **Fund your wallet**

    You need to have BNB in your wallet to start interacting with the Nubian dapp. Let's have a look at the different options you can use to [fund your wallet](fund-your-wallet.md) before we start making use of the Nubian decentralized application (dapp).
3.  **Start Using Nubian**

    After funding your wallet, you are ready to start using Nubian. Navigate to Nubian.finance on your desktop browser if you are using a wallet extension like Metamask or on your dapp browser.
4.  **Connect your Wallet**

    First thing you need to do is connect your wallet to see the assets you have and what you can use them to do on the Nubian.&#x20;
5.  **Explore Nubian**

    Great job :clap: if you were able to start the journey and get to this point, you can now start using Nubian by [exchanging ](../faqs/swap.md)your tokens or earn yield by [pooling](start-earning/pooling.md), [lending](start-earning/lend.md) and [farming](start-earning/farm.md).

We've come to the end of our short journey if you read and took action in the previous sections your journey to financial freedom has been reduce
