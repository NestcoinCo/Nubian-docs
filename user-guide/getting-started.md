# ðŸ‘¶ Getting Started

To start using Nubian right away you need a cryptocurrency wallet with funds in it. You can use these funds to earn more by saving to earn rewards as interest, exchange them or simply pay transaction fees. This guide is written for individuals with little cryptocurrency knowledge. It'll take you from converting your cash to crypto and engaging in financial activities on the blockchain. You must have heard about these activities before as Decentralized Finance (DeFi).

DeFi allows you to do all the activities you would normally do at the bank such as saving, to earn yield, on the blockchain. Say bye :wave: to ridiculous paperwork, stress, long bank queues, tiny :pinched\_fingers: interest rates and welcome :handshake: high-interest rates, freedom, complete control over your funds and an overall better user experience, especially with the Nubian web application.

Let's begin our short journey to financial freedom. Each stage has a link to a page explaining it in further detail.

1.  **Get a Wallet**

    The first thing you'd need is a wallet. In the same way, you'd pick a bank to patronise, you have to pick a wallet to use in holding your cryptocurrency and interacting with Nubian. Check our [wallets](wallets.md) guide to know the right wallet you need to get started.
2. **Connect to Nubian**\
   ****After getting a wallet you can connect it to Nubian to explore the User Interface (UI) and see what Nubian can help you do. If the wallet is new we have to first fund it before we can make transactions on Nubian.
3.  **Fund your wallet**

    You need to have BNB in your wallet to start interacting with the Nubian dapp, BNB is needed to pay transaction fees on the BNB smart chain. Let's have a look at the different options you can use to [fund your wallet](fund-your-wallet.md) before we start making use of the Nubian decentralized application (dapp).
4.  **Explore Nubian**

    Great job :clap: if you were able to start the journey and get to this point, you can now start using Nubian by [saving](save.md) tokens or [swapping](swap-your-tokens.md).

We've come to the end of our short journey. Kudos, if you read and took action in the previous sections you are the real OGs ðŸ¤œ ðŸ¤›.
