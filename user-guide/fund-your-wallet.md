# Fund your Wallet

After creating a new wallet, it's empty. You have to have cryptocurrency in it to start using it. Nubian Finance is built on the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and BSC requires BNB, it's native cryptocurrency to be paid as a transaction fee. This means you need to have BNB before you can start using Nubian.&#x20;

To receive cryptocurrency you are required to share your wallet address or a QR code representation of it. You will find it under the receive tab/button on most wallets. It's synonymous with a bank account number and has to be given to the sender. Below is a wallet address and QR code on Trust wallet.

The BNB in this context refers to BNB on the Binance Smart Chain BNB(BEP 20) and not BNB (BEP 2) on the Binance Chain. Two ways to ensure you aren't receivingyi BNB (BEP 2) are:

* The address must begin with **0x** e.g 0x2D4C407BBe49438ED859fe965b140dcF1aaB71a9 and not **bnb **e.g bnb1z35wusfv8twfele77vddclka9z84ugywug48gn
* You won't be asked for a **memo, **when sending the token to your address.
{% endhint %}

There are various methods to convert the cash in your possession to cryptocurrency. Here are a few of them. This is meant to be a short guide so we'll be looking at the one we think is the fastest.

**P2P**

You can buy directly from someone this involves sending or giving the person money and he gives you the equivalent value in cryptocurrency in return. This method prevents personal information from being exposed. A popular platform that supports BNB and has a P2P service is the [Binance](getting-started.md) P2P platform although you still have to create an account and do KYC.&#x20;

**Centralised Exchanges**

To buy cryptocurrency from a centralised exchange requires you to signup on these exchanges, complete KYC, deposit cash, sell your cash for BNB and then withdraw that BNB to your external wallet. [Binance](https://binance.com) and [Hotbit ](https://www.hotbit.io)are also good examples of exchanges that support this.

**Credit/Debit Cards**

You can buy cryptocurrency using your credit/debit card. It's one of the fastest means of getting cryptocurrency, although it does expose your personal details on your credit card to the company you are buying from. We'll go through a simple guide to buying BNB from [Moonpay](https://www.moonpay.com). Moonpay makes the process very easy you can also use other services that let you buy BNB to your wallet.
