# Swap Your Tokens

You can exchange your tokens for other tokens you want using the Nubian app. Swapping just means selling your token in exchange for another token.

Nubian makes the swapping process very easy and fast. To get started swapping, make sure you have the token you want to swap and then select the Swap button on your dashboard. You will be taken to the swap screen.

To proceed you have to select the tokens you want to sell and the token you want to buy. The number of tokens you will receive is automatically generated when you enter the number you want to sell and vice versa. The price for the swap is shown below the tokens. The swap also has a fee shown at the very bottom of the swap screen. This fee is collected by the exchange Nubian employs to complete the swap, Nubian does not collect any fee whatsoever.

When you select the Confirm Swap button you are redirected to approve the swap transaction on your wallet. When the swap completes, you will see a swap transaction under the transactions tab of your dashboard with appropriate changes in the token you sold and received under the assets tab.
