# üê∑ Save

The Nubian app is built primarily to help you save. Unlike traditional banks that offer little to no interest rates, interest rates on the Nubian app greatly dwarf those of traditional banks. Nubian is able to offer high-interest rates by leveraging the power of Decentralized Finance (DeFi). Apart from the high-interest rates, it also offers anyone, anywhere the opportunity to save, all you need is a smartphone, **no** **KYC,** and no long queues.

### Save

You can get started saving on Nubian from your dashboard. Select "Start a savings plan" card from your dashboard.

&#x20;                                             __                                              ![](../.gitbook/assets/dashboard\_save.jpg)__

&#x20;                                                           _****_**                                                                                **                    Savings plan

When you get to the Savings screen you first have to select the token you want to save. You need to have a balance of the token in your wallet. I have selected BUSD here.

&#x20;                                                                           ****                                                                            Select token to save

After selecting the token you can see the interest rate and your balance,  if it is not sufficient, go to [Fund your wallet](fund-your-wallet.md) to guide you on how to send the token to your wallet or [Swap](swap-your-tokens.md) for a guide on how to exchange one of your other tokens for the token you want to save.

&#x20;Enter the amount of token you want to save and select the "Continue" button. You will be prompted to approve the token if you haven't. Approvals let the Nubian app spend your tokens for you, without it, it won't be able to help you save. After approval, you will be redirected to your wallet to actually complete the save transaction. You have saved your tokens when the transaction successfully completes :relaxed:.

After saving, the savings page shows you an overview of all the tokens you have saved. Now that we've saved let's be sure we can get our money back.

### Withdraw Savings

Get to the Savings overview page from the dashboard using the savings button on the navigation menu.

&#x20;                                              ![](../.gitbook/assets/dashboard\_savings.jpg)

&#x20;                                                            Savings Navigation Item

On the savings overview page, select any savings you have done. This takes you to a page showing details about that saved token with a "Withdraw" button. Select the button to begin withdrawal.

&#x20;                                            ![](<../.gitbook/assets/saved\_token (1).jpg>)

&#x20;                                                                   Saved Token&#x20;

The withdrawal page requires you to enter the amount of the token you want to withdraw and select the "Confirm Withdrawal" button. If you haven't approved before, you will be asked to approve the token, this allows Nubian to complete the transaction for you. You will be redirected to your wallet to accept the approval and/or withdrawal transaction(s). When the transaction completes successfully, your formerly saved tokens will now be in your wallet.
