# Wallets

A wallet is a software that holds the details you need to be able to send and receive cryptocurrency and make transactions. To interact with Nubian Finance you need to have a DeFi wallet. A DeFi wallet does everything a normal wallet does and also enables you to interact with Decentralized Applications (Dapps).

Wallets hold keys that enable you to spend your cryptocurrency. These keys include your private keys and the mnemonic seed phrase they are meant to be kept secret and known only by you. If compromised the attacker can spend your funds. They also have an address which is a group of characters typically beginning with '0x' that is used to receive funds. 

There are multiple wallets for different platforms. Here are the wallets supported by Nubian Finance, categorised by platform.
