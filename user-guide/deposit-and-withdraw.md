# Deposit and Withdraw

Make deposits and withdrawals directly from the Nubian decentralized application (dapp) without having to go back to your wallet. The Nubian dapp contains a dashboard, which is used as the central point of navigation around the complete Nubian set of products. Anytime you connect your wallet, you see this dashboard.

The dashboard contains 3 main parts, bottom navigation, assets & transactions tabs and the portfolio section which contains the total balance and portfolio buttons for changing a user's portfolio.&#x20;

Let's take a look at two common portfolio buttons:

### Deposit

You can make deposits directly into the wallet currently connected to the Nubian app. To make a deposit you just have to select the deposit button on your Nubian dashboard. You are shown the screen below. The address of your wallet currently connected to the app you can copy and share to receive funds or just let the sender scan your QR code.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Only send BEP20 tokens to this address to avoid losing tokens.
{% endhint %}

### Withdraw

Make withdrawals from the Nubian app directly to an external wallet. To get to the Withdraw screen, select the withdraw button on your dashboard.

When you select the withdraw button, you will see the list of tokens you have a balance. Select the token you want to withdraw.

After selecting a withdrawal token, you will need to enter an address and the amount you want to withdraw. The address must be a BEP20 address i.e an address that can receive BEP20 tokens. You can select the maximum amount of tokens you have using the max button and switch between the dollar value and the number of tokens you want to withdraw using the switch button.&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
Always make sure the addresses you enter are correct. Sending tokens to the wrong address will make you lose those tokens.
{% endhint %}

Select the Confirm Withdrawal button when you are done. You will be directed to your wallet to confirm the withdrawal.
