# Developers

Nubian Finance is an open-source and community-driven project. We encourage developers and community members to find bugs in our code and fix them. If you do find a critical bug in any of our smart contracts please do reach out. Contact information is below. Before proceeding to fix a bug or improve the code, we encourage you to open an issue on the associated repository so appropriate discussions can be done on how to go about fixing it.  
Currently, developers can contribute to the frontend of the Nubian application and can help to add connectors to any DeFi protocol they feel needs to be part of the Nubian ecosytem. 

Thanks for making Nubian Finance sweeterðŸ’™. Happy Coding ðŸŽ‰.
