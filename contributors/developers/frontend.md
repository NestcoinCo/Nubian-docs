### Setup your Dev Environment

1. Fork the repository, create a [draft pull request](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) and clone to your local machine and add the official repository as an upstream branch. The git snippet below adds nubian-frontend as an upstream branch.

```text
$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/Open-Currency-Collective/nubian-frontend.git
```

2.  Make sure you have the latest version of the default branch. The git snippet below switches to the default branch and fetches the latest code.

### Creating Pull Requests

* It is recommended for you to create a [draft pull request](https://github.blog/2019-02-14-introducing-draft-pull-requests/) to keep the team abreast with your progress and it gives you a better chance of having your pull request merged.

* Your pull request should be as small as possible. If it is going to be a major change do reach out to the team using dev@nestcoin.com.

### Code Overview

The frontend code is well structured into different folders to allow for easy debugging, stability and code reusability giving a good developer experience. Here's an overview of each folder in the `src` directory. We recommend you put components, hooks, abis, api requests and so on in their most appropriate places.

* **/artifacts:** Contains all the contract \(Application Binary Interfaces\) ABIs, their deployed addresses and other necessary blockchain files.
* **/assets:** Contains all the graphic assets including svg, png, webp and jpg images. If you do add new images to this folder give them a name that easily identifies them.
* **/components**: Contains all the reusable presentation components with little or no business logic. Some of the components have multiple variations under a single folder. Do check through them before creating new components.
* **/hooks**: Contains shared logic between components to reduce redundancy. These are custom React hooks this allows them to use built-in React hooks like `useState`.
* **/libs**: Contains shared logic such as factory functions and helper functions. They do not make use of React hooks.
* **/stores:** Contains all Redux logic \(stores, reducers and actions\) for the application.
* **/styles:** Contains all the CSS logic and configuration files.
* **/views:** Page components are placed here.
