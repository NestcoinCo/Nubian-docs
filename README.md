Newbies and degens alike can monitor their portfolio and earn with ease, we handle the difficult parts and make the DeFi experience sweet:relaxed:.

## Products

### ðŸ”„ Swap

Swaps are one of the most basic features of DeFi. You can swap (sell your token for another token) your tokens on Nubian. Your swaps are routed through a decentralised exchange and you are given the token you desire. You are able to see the number of tokens you would get before the swap is initiated, the exchange rate and can select different percentages of your token balance to swap.

## Earn

The DeFi ecosystem is well known for its high-interest rates and subsequent yields. Nubian offers all these products to users without them having to go from one protocol to another to access them.

### ðŸ’¸ Lend

Start earning interest on your tokens by lending them. You can lend any amount of tokens and withdraw them with interest at any time. The interest rates are very high compared to what the bank gives you for lending your money to their customers when you make deposits.

### ðŸŒŠ Pooling

Earn interest in swap fees by providing liquidity to any of the trading pairs on decentralised exchange (dex) we support. This allows you to earn a part of the swap fee anytime someone makes a swap using the pair you provided liquidity. Pancake swap is a typical example of a dex.

### ðŸšœ Farm

Yield farming allows you to earn even more interest after [providing liquidity](user-guide/start-earning/pooling.md) to a trading pair on any dex. When you provide liquidity, you are given pool ([Liquidity Provider](broken-reference)) tokens to track the amount of liquidity you provided. These LP tokens can be used to earn more rewards by staking them in a farm (a pool for staking LP tokens to earn rewards) to earn even more interest which is separate from the amount you earn in trading fees for providing liquidity.
