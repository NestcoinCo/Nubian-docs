# ðŸ‘‹ Nubian Introduction

Nubian Finance is a decentralized savings application. It allows you to save crypto with high-interest rates.&#x20;

We know saving in the bank has always been a pain. They offer low-interest rates and charge you fees for saving with them. At the end of the day, the charges far outweigh the meagre interest and you withdraw less than you put in initially.&#x20;

Nubian Finance allows you to save your crypto with interest rates typically higher than 2%. No single fee is charged on the amount saved.&#x20;

Nubian offers you the freedom to save any amount you want and withdraw it anytime you want, you are not asked to do Know Your Customer (KYC) and provide any personal documents or stand in a long queue before you can deposit your funds.&#x20;

To get started using the Nubian application, all you need is a smartphone, just navigate to [app.nubian.fi ](https://app.gitbook.com/o/-MjEXC7c-JaMUV\_saKA-/s/-MjH29tAXWR37NNVM7u5/)and get started saving.
