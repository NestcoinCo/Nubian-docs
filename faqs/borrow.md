# ðŸ¤² Borrow

### How much do I pay back when I borrow?

The amount of tokens you pay back when you borrow depends on the percentage interest rate. 

### Why are all the interest rates negative?

This helps you recognise that you will pay the additional interest when you borrow. A negative interest rate of 5% when you borrow 3BNB means you will pay back 3.15BNB (3BNB + (5% \* 3BNB)) when you do not pay anything back for up to a year.

### What Money Market do I borrow from?

Nubian uses Venus protocol to help you borrow funds.

### Does Nubian collect fees when I borrow or payback?

Nubian does not collect any fees whatsoever but the money market used may collect a fee.

### What is the collaterals tab?

Before you can borrow, you must provide collateral. Since the money market used in borrowing and lending is Venus, the assets you lend on Nubian act as your collateral. They will show up under this collateral tab.
