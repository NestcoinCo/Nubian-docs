# ðŸŒŠ Liquidity Provision

### What is Liquidity?

Liquidity is a measure of how easy it is to exchange an asset for another. When you provide liquidity for an asset, you make it easy to exchange an asset. E.g when you provide liquidity in BNB and DAI you are effectively saying people can come and exchange their BNB for DAI and vice versa using your tokens i.e they give you DAI or BNB and you give them an equivalent amount of BNB or DAI.

### What is liquidity provision?

Liquidity provision is the process of providing tokens to be used in facilitating swaps from one token to another. 

### What do I need to provide liquidity?

You need just equivalent values of the two tokens you want to use in providing liquidity.

### Why do I have to provide two tokens?

Your tokens are sent to a decentralized exchange (dex) and the dex makes use of pairs of tokens to enable swaps. When you provide liquidity, you add your tokens to those pairs and they require that the equivalent value of the two tokens be added to a pair.

### What happens when I don't have any or one of the two tokens?

You can swap any of your tokens to the token you need using the Nubian swap feature on your dashboard.

### How do I earn when I provide liquidity?

You get to share the swap fees with the other liquidity providers in your pool. So you earn rewards when the pool you provide liquidity to is used in a swap.

### What are LP tokens?

LP (Liquidity Provider) tokens are tokens given to Liquidity providers to track the amount of liquidity they have provided in a particular pool.  Each pool has its own LP tokens and you automatically get them when you provide liquidity to that pool.

### What is a liquidity pool?

A liquidity pool is a pair of tokens that are used to enable swaps between the two tokens on a decentralized exchange.

### Can I pullout my liquidity at any point?

Yes, you can.

### If the pair is not swapped by anyone what anything happen to my liquidity?

No, nothing happens to your liquidity.

### Why do I get less value than the value I provided as liquidity?

This is due to impermanent loss.

### What is impermanent loss?
