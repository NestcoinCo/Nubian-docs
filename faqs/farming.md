# Farming

### What is Farming?

Yield farming is a means of locking up tokens to earn rewards. It differs from simple staking where you earn rewards for simply locking NBN tokens. In farming, you stake Liquidity Provider \(LP\) tokens, allowing you to earn rewards in trading fees from your LP tokens and earn additional rewards in other tokens for staking your LP tokens.

### What Yield Farm does Nubian use?

Nubian Finance uses AutoFarm.

### How do I get the tokens to use on the Farm?

Before you can stake tokens in the farm you need to have LP tokens. They can be obtained when you provide liquidity on Pancakeswap. Check the Farming tab to know the right LP token you need which will, in turn, tell you the tokens you need to provide liquidity for to get the LP token.

### How do I receive my farming rewards?

You get your rewards in AUTO tokens and your initial deposit is also compounded automatically.

### Does Nubian charge a fee for farming?

Nubian does not charge any fee whatsoever. But Autofarm does have some underlying fees.
