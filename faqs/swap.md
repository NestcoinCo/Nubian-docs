# ðŸ”„ Swap

### What is a swap?

A swap is an exchange of a token for another token.

### Why does my token have a zero balance on the swap page?

To swap your tokens they have to be in the selected DeFi Smart Account (DSA). Check if the token appears under assets on the Dashboard tab, if you don't see it it means they aren't present in the current DSA. Check if it's in your other DSAs or your crypto wallet like Metamask.

### What is slippage?

The slippage sets the minimum amount of tokens you will accept for the swap. Setting the slippage with percentage effectively says you won't accept more than that percentage reduction in the token amount you get from the swap when the transaction is completed. Setting the slippage of a swap you are meant 2BNB to 2% says you do not want less than 1.96BNB (2 - (2% \* 2BNB)). The transaction fails if you get below 1.96BNB.

### Where do I set slippage?

Nubian automatically sets a default slippage, but you can change it at the top settings icon under the Swap tab.

### Why don't I approve a token before it is swapped?

The DeFi Smart Account (DSA) handles the approval before the token is swapped and prevents the Decentralized Exchange (DEX) used in the swap from having infinite approvals.

### What DEX does Nubian use for the swap?

Nubian currently uses Pancakeswap for the swaps but plans on using other Dexes and Dex aggregators to give users the best rates.

### Does Nubian take a fee for swaps?

No Nubian does not take any fee for swaps.

### Why does the value of the tokens I get not match the value of the tokens I swap?

The DEX Nubian uses charges a fee for each swap. Nubian does not collect any fees.
