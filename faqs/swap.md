# ðŸ”„ Swap

### What is a swap?

A swap is an exchange of a token for another token.

### What is slippage?

The slippage sets the minimum amount of tokens you will accept for the swap. Setting the slippage with percentage effectively says you won't accept more than that percentage reduction in the token amount you get from the swap when the transaction is completed. Setting the slippage of a swap you are meant to get 2BNB to 2% says you do not want less than 1.96BNB (2 - (2% \* 2BNB)). The transaction fails if you get below 1.96BNB.

### Where do I set slippage?

Nubian automatically sets a default slippage, but you can change it at the top settings icon under the Swap tab.

### What DEX does Nubian use for the swap?

Nubian currently uses Pancakeswap for the swaps but plans on using other Dexes and Dex aggregators to give users the best rates.

### Does Nubian take a fee for swaps?

No Nubian does not take any fee for swaps.

### Why does the value of the tokens I get not match the value of the tokens I swap?

The DEX Nubian uses charges a fee for each swap. Nubian does not collect any fees.
